The Loaded Maggie is a modifief version of Maggie I developed. It's actually modified version of the Masala Maggie that most of the people make. I created it to explore what new flavours go with our simple "2-Minute" Maggie. This version of is suited to be eaten in groups rather than just eating it alone.
